Hello!

I created a Wordpress theme from scratch for The Sidewinder Tavern in Denver (www.thesidewindertavern.com). This github repo contains that Wordpress theme. It was not created to be "out of the box" used by anyone else, but if you want to check it out, or modify it for your own use, that's okay by me. 

If you do, please:

1. Change the logo image to something you own.

2. Please leave my credit in the footer

3. Let me know where you've used it! I'd love to see your work. kelleykavanaugh@gmail.com

Some "features" of this theme (current version):

~ Powered with Bootstrap to be fully scalable!

~ Powered by the wonderful Google Calendar Events Plugin (http://rhanney.co.uk/plugins/google-calendar-events/) (Some of this plugins features are modified in the style.css sheet for the theme)

~ Powered by Soliloquy Lite (http://soliloquywp.com/) for the slider on the mainpage. To use your own slider, exchange this code in index.php with your Soliloquy number:
'''html
<?php if ( function_exists( 'soliloquy_slider' ) ) soliloquy_slider( '79' ); ?>
'''

~ The 3 column footer is using Bootstraps "span4" class, and will only support 3 widgets.

Please let me know if you use my Wordpress theme, or if you need help with anything on it! kelleykavanaugh@gmail.com

Thanks,

Kelley Kavanaugh
